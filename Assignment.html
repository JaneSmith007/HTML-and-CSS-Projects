		The book "The Little Prince" has been cherished by the people of France
		since 1943. It is an allegory that was so well-received that the image of 
		The Little Prince was represented on the currency of the Franc noted on 
		the 50 franc banknote, before France had adopted the use of the euro as 
		as currency. A noted quote from The Little Prince is <q>What is essential is invisble to the eye</q>, 
		a concept that has changed many people's outlook on what is important in life.
